# Changelog

All notable changes to IronCache are documented here. The format follows

adopt [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) once it ships a
release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- First engine code (PR-1 "Boot + wire"): a Cargo virtual workspace and a
  minimal-but-real server that accepts RESP connections and answers the Tier-0
  connection commands. Seven crates: `ironcache-env` (the determinism Env seam,
  ADR-0003), `ironcache-protocol` (RESP2/RESP3 codec and the verbatim error
  catalog, PROTOCOL.md/ERRORS.md/ADR-0019), `ironcache-runtime` (the swappable
  Runtime trait and a shared-nothing tokio current-thread, per-core-pinned
  bootstrap with SO_REUSEPORT per-shard accept, RUNTIME.md/ADR-0002),
  `ironcache-config` (layered TOML config with human-size parsing, CONFIG.md),
  `ironcache-observe` (INFO sections and per-shard rollup counters,
  OBSERVABILITY.md), `ironcache-server` (the HELLO-driven connection state
  machine and Tier-0 dispatch: PING/HELLO/AUTH/SELECT/QUIT/RESET/CLIENT/COMMAND/
  INFO/ECHO), and the `ironcache` binary (clap subcommands server|cli|bench|
  check|config|upgrade, the redis-cli argv[0] alias, jemalloc global allocator
  per ADR-0006, graceful SIGINT/SIGTERM shutdown).
- Rust CI workflow (`.github/workflows/rust.yml`) with the docs-only guard idiom:
  fmt, clippy (pedantic, -D warnings), test (ubuntu + macos), MSRV 1.85, a musl
  static build, and grep-based invariant lints
  (`scripts/ci/check-rust-invariants.sh`) enforcing no-fork, the determinism
  Env-seam boundary, shared-nothing locks, and the SPDX header on every source.
- `deny.toml` (cargo-deny license allowlist, advisories, sources),
  `rust-toolchain.toml` (pinned stable channel), and a committed `Cargo.lock`.
- Project scaffolding: dual `MIT OR Apache-2.0` license, Code of Conduct,
  Contributing guide, Governance, and Security policy.
- The vision EPIC and the research and specification issue tree.
- Prior-art research corpus under `docs/research/`, the version-pinned
  `docs/prior-art/claims.yaml`, and the `docs/PRIOR_ART.md` survey.
- Pre-implementation audit (`docs/AUDIT.md`): every issue audited and given a
  verdict comment, 5 prior-art claims re-verified and corrected, 27 split
  sub-issues filed from 9 decomposed parents, and 36 coverage-gap issues filed.

### Changed

- Corrected 5 prior-art claims in `docs/prior-art/claims.yaml` after
  re-verification (provenance preserved via `verification.reaudited`).

### Fixed

- Removed or relinked broken citations in issue bodies (#83, #88, #97).
